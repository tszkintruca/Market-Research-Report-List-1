<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drug Coated Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Everolimus-Coated Stent</li><li>Zotarolimus-Coated Stent</li><li>Ridaforolimus-Coated Stent</li><li>SYNERGY Coated Stent</li><li>Orsiro Coated Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The drug-coated stent market includes several types, each utilizing different drugs to prevent restenosis after angioplasty. Everolimus-coated stents release Everolimus, an immunosuppressant that inhibits cell proliferation. Zotarolimus-coated stents use Zotarolimus for similar effects. Ridaforolimus-coated stents incorporate Ridaforolimus, targeting pathways involved in cell growth. SYNERGY coated stents feature a unique bioresorbable polymer, while Orsiro coated stents combine biocompatibility with dual drug release for enhanced healing. These stents improve patient outcomes by reducing the risk of artery blockage recurrence.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Drug Coated Stent Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angioplasty</li><li>Restenosis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The drug-coated stent market is primarily driven by applications in angioplasty and the management of restenosis. During angioplasty, these stents are inserted into narrowed arteries to keep them open, enhancing blood flow. Their drug-eluting technology helps prevent restenosis, or the re-narrowing of the artery, by gradually releasing medication that inhibits cell proliferation. This dual functionality not only improves patient outcomes but also addresses the need for effective long-term solutions in coronary artery disease treatments.</p></p>
