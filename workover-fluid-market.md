<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Workover Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brine</li><li>Polymer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The workover fluid market primarily comprises two types: brine and polymer. Brine solutions, typically composed of water and dissolved salts, are used for their density and low cost, helping maintain well pressure and prevent influx of fluids. Polymer-based workover fluids, on the other hand, utilize synthetic materials to enhance viscosity and stability, providing better wellbore support and minimizing fluid loss. Both types cater to different well conditions and operational requirements, optimizing performance in workover operations.</p></p>
