<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gypsum Foaming Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stable Foaming Agents</li><li>Unstable Foaming Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gypsum foaming agents market is divided into stable and unstable foaming agents. Stable foaming agents create long-lasting bubbles that maintain their structure and volume, resulting in a consistent texture and enhanced fire resistance in gypsum products. In contrast, unstable foaming agents produce short-lived bubbles, leading to rapid collapse and lower product density. Each type serves specific applications, with stable agents ideal for high-quality construction materials and unstable agents often suited for less demanding environments.</p></p>
